## Model Requirements

- Format: GLB or GLTF (GLB is preferred for web)
- Optimize for web: Keep file size under 10MB if possible
- Proper materials and textures should be included in the model

## Example Model

The application is configured to use a model named `chess_set.glb` by default. If you use a different filename, you'll need to update the `src` attribute in the `model-viewer` tag in `src/index.html`.
