# Assets Directory

This directory contains assets for the Chess WebAR Experience.

## Required Assets

1. `environment.hdr` - HDR environment map for realistic lighting of the 3D model
2. `poster.webp` - Image to show while the 3D model is loading

## Where to Find HDR Maps

You can find free HDR environment maps at:
- [Poly Haven](https://polyhaven.com/hdris)
- [HDR Labs](http://www.hdrlabs.com/sibl/archive.html)

## Creating a Poster Image

The poster image should be:
- Format: WebP (for better compression) or PNG/JPG
- Dimensions: Recommended 1000x1000 or similar aspect ratio
- Contents: A nice preview of the chess set or themed image

These assets will be automatically copied to the build directory during the build process.
